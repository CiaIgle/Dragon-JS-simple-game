# Dragon Repeller (a simple RPG JS game)
As part of my training as a FullStack developer I followed the YT tutorial [Full Stack Web Development for Beginners (Full Course on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu_pCVPKzTk&t=14959s) I only did the first JS part.

## Warning
NO CSS done on this (missing) I just used the most basic HTML necessary to test the JS code.

## Resources
I used [sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/es/) as online editor and interpreter. 

## To Do 
- CÃ³digo CSS
- Limpiar JS (eliminar console.log)
- COMENTAR
